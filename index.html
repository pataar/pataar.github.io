                <h2>Hello.</h2>
                <p>My name is Pieter Willekens. I am a 24 year old developer from The Netherlands. </p>

            <p>
                I am a webdeveloper that likes to know and learn everything about technology. I currently work for a company called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.interactivestudios.nl">Interactive Studios</a>,
                a company that makes cool webbased products. One of them is the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.patientjourneyapp.com">Patient Journey App</a>, an app that provides relevant information to patients at the right time.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this particulary moment I like to work with both Laravel and NodeJS. In the future I would like to learn <a target="_blank" href="https://facebook.github.io/react">React</a> and perhaps some more Ruby (w/ Rails). And contributing to Open Source projects is something that I would like to do more.
            </p>
            <p>Next to programming, I like to make and listen to music as well. Going to concerts and festivals are one of my favorite things to do. At home I play a lot of drums and listen often to some vinyl records. I'm a big fan of movies and TV series as well. (I really recommend Mr. Robot at the moment!)</p>

            <h3>Things I like to work with</h3>
            <p>
                During my work I use several languages and frameworks. During my time with <a href="http://www.interactivestudios.nl">Interactive Studios</a> I've learned to work with NodeJS, Angular and Laravel.
                Which I really like.

                        <h4>Patient Journey App</h4>
                        <p>
                            At <a href="https://www.interactivestudios.nl">Interactive Studios</a> I'm mainly working on the <a href="https://patientjourneyapp.com">Patient Journey App</a>. It's an app that provides information on the right time to patients. The content is fully managable by the Hospitals or Clinics providing the app. The app is built using <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic Framework</a> and using custom built plugins and scripts. We've won several awards with the app. For more information check out <a href="https://patientjourneyapp.com">patientjourneyapp.com</a></p>

                        <h4>Teamplay</h4>
                        <p>Teamplay is a team management system made for sport teams. Teams can either track their scores, see the schedule or the standings. But are also
                        able to select a MVP for each match. It has a built in scraper to fetch the latests scores of matches. <br >
                        It is built on a custom framework called Surface which I made during the development of Teamplay. All written in PHP.</p>

                        <h4>Open Source projects</h4>
                        <p>I've made some open source projects as well. Currently there are 2 node modules which I've published publicly under the MIT license. One of these modules is called Logar. Which is a simple utility that helps you log to stdout.</p>
                        <p>The other one is called dir-templar. Which can parse an entire directory through lodash's template engine, and places the content inside an other directory.</p>

                        You can find more information on my <a href="https://github.com/pataar">github page.</a>
