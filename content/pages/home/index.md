# Hi there.

### My name is Pieter Willekens. I am a 28 year old developer from the Netherlands.

I am a developer that likes to know and learn everything about technology. The continuously evolving aspect of it really keeps it interesting. I feel there's always something to discover and explore.

I currently work for a company
called [Interactive Studios](https://www.interactivestudios.nl), which is a company that mainly develops health related products. One of them is the [Patient Journey App](https://www.patientjourneyapp.com), an app that provides relevant information to patients at the right time. This app is my main focus at Interactive Studios. I'm either programming for the application or scripting to improve the CI pipelines. I also do a lot of server administration regarding the application. (Docker is awesome!)

During programming I'm doing backend work in the LAMP stack, and frontend work in React and Typescript. In the future I would like to learn [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) because of its speed and efficiency and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) (in combination with Dart) for its cross-platform capabilities. Contributing to Open Source projects is also something that I like doing and would like to do much more.

Next to work, I'm a dad, play the drums, often listen to some vinyl records, tinkering with IoT and home automation and into gaming. I'm a big fan of movies and TV series as well. Especially everything Star Wars and Lord of the Rings related.

Other interests of mine are astronomy, physics and a bit of philosophy. On amateur level of course.
