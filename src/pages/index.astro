		<h1>I'm Pieter Willekens</h1>
		<p>
			I'm a developer driven by curiosity about technology. The field's constant evolution keeps me engaged and motivated to explore new possibilities.
		</p>
		<p>
			At <a href="https://www.interactivestudios.nl">Interactive Studios</a>, I serve as tech lead for the 
			<a href="https://www.patientjourneyapp.com">Patient Journey App</a>, a health-focused application that provides patients with contextual information at critical moments. I manage both the technical development and infrastructure, handling everything from application architecture to CI/CD optimization and DevOps work using Kubernetes.
		</p>
		<p>
			My technical work spans backend development with Laravel and PHP, frontend development using React and TypeScript, and mobile development with React Native and Expo. I work extensively with Kubernetes for deployment orchestration and am exploring <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> for its performance characteristics. I actively contribute to open source projects and aim to increase my involvement in the community.
		</p>
		<p>
			Beyond my professional work, I balance family life as a father with various personal interests including music (I play drums), vinyl collecting, IoT and home automation projects, 3D printing, and managing my homelab server. I also enjoy gaming and am particularly drawn to science fiction and fantasy, with a special appreciation for Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.
		</p>
		<p>I'm also fascinated by astronomy and physics, topics I enjoy exploring outside of my technical work.</p>
